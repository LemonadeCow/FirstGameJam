# Just sad for now

#### Been trying to figure out a name for this game for awhile but nothing really comes to mind. I have surprisingly been enjoying making it even if I'm not as intensely following it as my last one.

## Ideas

* I can probably draw out my sprites in my notebook and just import those to the project just to make a really weird and kind of "mushed" aesthetic that ironically doesn't really follow any single look

* gardening !!!!, I'm probably gonna draw this out in my notebook since I can't really use my drawing tablet lol

## Logging
Well it's 12:39 AM and I'm currently staying in a hotel for a program coming up soon. I haven't been coding too much and my mental health has really gotten the best of me lately. I'm trying to stay healthy so I might not finish in time for the game jam's deadline. 

I should probably get to drawing soon too since there's quite a bit I need to do.

Yeah I can't code right now, I'll try again soon.

# I'm Back

It's been like a couple day since I last updated this game so I'm back on it.
