# What's Goin On?

#### Been trying to figure out a name for this game for awhile but nothing really comes to mind. I have surprisingly been enjoying making it even if I'm not as intensely following it as my last one.

## Ideas

* I can probably draw out my sprites in my notebook and just import those to the project just to make a really weird and kind of "mushed" aesthetic that ironically doesn't really follow any single look

* gardening !!!!, I'm probably gonna draw this out in my notebook since I can't really use my drawing tablet lol
